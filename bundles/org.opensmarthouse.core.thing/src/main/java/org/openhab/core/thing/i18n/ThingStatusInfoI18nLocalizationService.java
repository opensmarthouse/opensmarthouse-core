/**
 * <p>
 * The {@link ThingStatusInfoI18nLocalizationService} can be used to localize the {@link ThingStatusInfo} of a thing
 * using the I18N mechanism of the openHAB framework. Currently the description of the {@link ThingStatusInfo}
 * is the single attribute which can be localized.
 *
 * <p>
 * In order to provide a localized description the corresponding {@link ThingHandler} of the thing does not provide a
 * localized string in the <i>ThingStatus.description</i> attribute, but instead provides the reference of the
 * localization string, e.g &#64;text/rate_limit. The handler is able to provide placeholder values as a JSON-serialized
 * array of strings:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;text/rate_limit ["60", "10", "@text/hour"]
 * </pre>
 *
 * <pre>
 * rate_limit=Device is blocked by remote service for {0} minutes. Maximum limit of {1} configuration
 * changes per {2} has been exceeded. For further info please refer to device vendor.
 * </pre>
