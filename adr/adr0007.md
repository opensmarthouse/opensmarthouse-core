# Add ThingType versioning 

## Status

PROPOSED

## Context

To allow the system to know if the ThingType definition has changed, a version identifier should be added to the ThingType. This will allow the system to update the thing based on the new Thing Type definition.

The `version` should be added to the `ThingType`, and provided by thing type providers such as the XML provider. This should be reflected into the instantiated `Thing` and provided in the `ThingDTO` for use in the user interface.

Thing Type XML definition -:

```
	<thing-type id="sample" version="2">
```

It shall then be possible for the user to decide to upgrade to the new definition. This functionality could be provided automatically, however this may result in unexpected changes to a users system as channels could be removed. Such updates are therefore considered to be better if manually initiated by the user.

Thing REST response (part) -:

```
{
  UID: "test:sample:505f8d7b12",
  thingTypeUID: "test:sample",
  thingTypeVersion: 2
}
```
