# Add binding events concept

## Status

PROPOSED

## Context

Often a binding will need to provide notifications to users for binding specific administrative purposes. This is not linked to `Item` data, but is designed to provide users feedback on binding specific functions or alerts. Examples of this could be -:

* Alerting the user about failed joining, or a trust issue with devices joining

In general, these notifications are designed for display on an administration UI rather than a user UI, but there is of course nothing to prevent any UI from subsribing for such events.

The concept is to provide a generic binding notification that allows a binding to send a simple notification to users that can be interpretted by UIs in a standard way. This should provide enough information to allow the UI to present the notification in a standard way - showing the severity, and a notification text.
