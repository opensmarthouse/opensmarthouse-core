# Architectural Decision Record Log

This log contains the status of all ADRs (Architectural Decision Records) for _OpenSmartHouse_.

An ADR is to be produced for all proposed significant architectural changes to _OpenSmartHouse_ - even if they are not implemented. This allows us to record why we have implemented a feature, and understanding why something was not implemented is equally as important.
