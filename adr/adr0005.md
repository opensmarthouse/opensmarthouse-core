# Differentiate thing handler and device configuration

## Status

PROPOSED

## Context

It has long been stated in ESH that the existing Configuration Parameter API is only meant for Thing Handler configuration and not device configuration. Many bindings use this for device configuration as well as handler configuration. From discussions on ESH, the following distinction was noted -:

* Handler configuration is merely about configuration of communication parameters, like ip address/host & port, timeouts, access tokens, thing ids, etc.
* Thing configuration should describe and model the configuration of the physical device. It should not only provide a view but provide an interface to alter the thing configuration. It is the bindings responsibility to implement the read/write access to the corresponding thing.

It is proposed to keep things simple - levering off the existing configuration parameter definition that are already being used for device configuration. There should be an indication in the parameter that this is a thing configuration, and there should be a method to define device specific information that the binding can use when sending data to the device.

The proposal is to add a new `device-properties` element to the configuration description. The defines a set of properties similar to other sets of properties defines in the XML descriptions. The properties may be used by the binding to specify binding and device specific information that is interpretted by the binding when sending the configuration to the device.

Despite the ESH configuration definitions apparently only being for handler configuration, there is a `ConfigStatusProvider` service that allows the binding to provide configuration status via the `ConfigStatusMessage` enum. This allows the binding to set status as `PENDING`, which "should be used if the transmission of the configuration parameter to the entity is pending". This should be persisted along with the `ConfigurationParameter` so that the binding is able to establish if configuration still needs to be sent to the device when it starts.
