# _OpenSmartHouse_ Core

This project contains core bundles of the _OpenSmartHouse_ runtime.


_OpenSmartHouse_ Core is not a product itself, but a framework on which to build a solutions. _OpenSmartHouse_ is highly modular to allow it to support systems on devices with highly constrained resources without additional bloat.

_OpenSmartHouse_ is based on a fork of Eclipse Smart Home and is designed to be kept in sync with _OpenHAB_ as much as possible. _OpenSmartHouse_ has additional features to support enterprise systems and advanced use cases that are not required within _OpenHAB_.
